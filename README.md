# Hungry ToDo Monster – School Group Project

Welcome to the land of productivity, where a mighty (and slightly grumpy) monster lives.
This monster isn’t interested in gold, fame, or glory… it only hungers for ToDo tasks.

Our team built this app as a school project to learn how to design, build and deploy a full-stack application.
The result? A hungry ToDo Monster app that only stays happy if you keep feeding it tasks.
Forget to feed it? Well… let’s just say you won’t like it when it’s hungry.

## Tech Stack (Monster’s Diet)

- **Main Course (Backend):** ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Side Dish (Database):** Azure SQL Database
- **Dessert (Frontend):** React + TailwindCSS (deliciously styled)
- **Lunchbox (Containerization):** Docker
- **Serving Plate (Infrastructure):** Azure Container Apps (ACA)
- **Chef’s Recipe (IaC):** Bicep templates
- **Kitchen Automation (CI/CD):** Azure DevOps Pipelines (no human hands required!)

## How It Works

### ASP.NET API (Monster’s Stomach)
- Handles all CRUD operations for tasks.
- Stores tasks in Azure SQL, because even monsters like organized meals.

### React Frontend (Monster’s Mouth)
- A tasty interface where users add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Styled with TailwindCSS, because the monster insists on looking fabulous.

### Docker (Monster’s Lunchbox)
- Both API and frontend are containerized.
- Ensures the monster can be fed anywhere – locally, in the cloud, or even in space.

### Azure Infrastructure (Monster’s Cave)
- Deployed with Bicep templates to guarantee a cozy and repeatable habitat.
- Runs happily inside Azure Container Apps.

### CI/CD (Monster’s Conveyor Belt)
- Azure DevOps Pipelines feed the monster automatically with new builds.
- Every push = fresh tasks delivered straight to Azure.

## The Team (Monster Keepers)

Each team member took responsibility for keeping the monster happy by:
- Cooking backend meals (API)
- Preparing frontend snacks (React + Tailwind)
- Organizing the monster’s pantry (SQL Database)
- Packing its lunchbox (Docker)
- Building its cave (Bicep + Azure)
- Setting up its auto-feeder (Azure DevOps Pipelines)

## Lessons Learned

- Monsters get cranky if you forget database migrations.
- TailwindCSS makes the monster look fancy while munching.
- Docker makes the monster portable in a lunchbox.
- Azure Container Apps + Bicep = monster-sized cloud magic.
- Azure DevOps Pipelines are basically a conveyor belt of snacks for the beast.
- Working together is the only way to keep a productivity monster under control.
